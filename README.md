# sample-discord-bot
This REP contains a small folder with a very simple and basic sample discord bot that can be fully customized. This includes 3 commands, activity, logging, on ready message, token etc

For each variable, ammend the text contained in "" next to it. Replace the token with your own token, replace the prefix to one that you wish to use.
The prefix should be short, such as "." or "!". 
The status may contain helpful information, such as the prefix it uses, or just something fun. 

In order to change the bots username, profile picture and about me, use the applications website from Discord
