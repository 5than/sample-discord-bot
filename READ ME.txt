Hello! Thankyou for using my sample-discord-bot.

To use this bot, please adjust all variables in var.json.

Within the var.json file, there may be a variable ending in "Check". If you want this variable
to happen, keep the variable as "True". If you dont want the variable, set it to "False".

the "command" variables are needed to tell the bot what commands you want.

If the variable ends in "Prompt", this variable is the command that users will enter
such as "help".

If the variable ends in "Response", this variable is the bots response to the command
